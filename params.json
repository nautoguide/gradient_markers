  "body": "### Gradient Markers.\r\nNautoguide's CEO, Dave Barter is a \"slightly\" obsessed cyclist. He spends a lot of his spare time seeking out the best hills on which to test his skinny frame. This in turn requires maps and contours to tell Dave where the gradients lie. For years he has pored over Ordnance Survey maps looking for the single and double chevrons. But sadly OS have yet to release these within any of their open data sets. So Dave tasked himself with trying to find this gradients through open data. This repo is the start of the search and contains some early prototype code and instructions. Please feel free to digest and comment, it would be great if we could create an overlay of gradient markers for every single British road ..and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The idea\r\nIn the UK we  classify road gradients on a percentage scale with a 14% gradient representing a height gain over 14% over a given distance. So if I climb 14 metres in height over 100 metres I am on a 14% incline. Ordnance Survey maps show gradients using two type of marker, a single chevron (>) indicates a gradient of 14-20%, a double chevron (>>) indicates a gradient of 20% or greater. The idea is to attach height values to open data road line strings so that we can then search them for our required gradients. When we find a gradient that is greater than 14% we will classify it and output a point geometry that represents either a single or double chevron. \r\n\r\n### Adding Height Data to Linestrings\r\nDave has tried three approaches so far:-\r\n\r\n1. Use an ASTER_DEM Raster to add height data to the line string at intervals of 30 metres \r\n2. Use the ASTER_DEM Raster to create contours, then use the intersection of these contours with the line string to add height data at 10m height increments\r\n3. Use the OS Opendata Terrain 50 contour shape files to achieve the same as 2, this has given the best results so far\r\n\r\n###QGIS Plugin\r\nAt the moment QGIS cannot display Z values for geometries, so Dave wrote a crude python plugin to achieve this.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDave Barter @citizenfish\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
